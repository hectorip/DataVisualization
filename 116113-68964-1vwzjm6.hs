Data Visualization notes and exercises from the course in [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/courses/ud507).


I expect to finish this in February'16 and share all my exercises here. If you want some explanation or contribute something to this repository you're welcome.

Why?
--
 I think sharing this publicly will force me to make an effort to finish the course(I have never finished an online course or a MOOC, shame on me) and make progress continuosly.
